								<p>Understanding how things work on a fundamental level has been a driving obsession of mine for as long as I can remember. The moment I got access to the internet I started reading every single how-to website and watching every explainer that I could get my hands on.</p>
								<p>When it finally came time to choose my major for college, Computer Science was the obvious choice. Four years later, after studying at University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and spending a semester in Tokyo, Japan, I earned my BS in Computer Science. During that time, I created a few things that I'd like to share with you on this website.</p>
